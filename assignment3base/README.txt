6.4400 Assignment 3
Ash Ahmed

• How do you compile and run your code? Specify which OS you have tested on.
Intel Mac, compile with make from the build directory, then run ./assignment3 [e, t, r] [time step size, float]

• Did you collaborate with anyone in the class? If so, let us know who you talked to and what sort
of help you gave or received.
Nope

• Were there any references (books, papers, websites, etc.) that you found particularly helpful for
completing your assignment? Please provide a list. In particular, mention if you borrowed the
model(s) used as your artifact from somewhere.
Nope

• Are there any known problems with your code? If so, please provide a list and, if possible, describe
what you think the cause is and how you might fix them if you had more time or motivation. This
is very important, as we’re much more likely to assign partial credit if you help us understand
what’s going on.
Nope, everything works and mirrors the sample solution (only difference is exact location of objects, and I used 8 particles
for the pendulum simulation).

• Did you do any of the extra credit? If so, let us know how to use the additional features. If there
was a substantial amount of work involved, describe how you did it.
Nope

• Do you have any comments about this assignment that you’d like to share? We know this was a
tough one, but did you learn a lot from it? Or was it overwhelming?
Very rewarding and chugged along nicely - inertia with starting/understanding things initially was higher than previous
assignments for me!
